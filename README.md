# reactjs-4-ways
same react code written in jsx, jsnox, react-hyperscript, and plain javscript

this is just an example to show the same reactjs code written with 4 different syntaxes. To be able to easily compare the differences.
uses react-typeahead for no reason other than that is what I was using for the project i was working on at the time.
